 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Introduction</b>: This language is known as Cebuano or
     Bisaya. It originates from the tribe of Cebu, centered in the area that is
     now the city of Cebu. However, due to immigration and historical
     influences, the use of that language has spread with multiple dialects
     from central Philippines all the way to the Southern end of Mindanao. It
     is the 2nd most spoken language in the Philippines. The formal version
     centered in Cebu City is called “Cebuano”. But all together the dialects
     are called “Bisaya”. The dialects are very similar to each other. The
     speaker of one dialect can generally be understood by other Bisaya
     speakers. You will be learning the Bisaya dialect of Northern Mindanao. It
     has over 90% commonality with formal Cebuano. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Basic Sentence Structure</b>: While sentence structure
     can vary significantly, in each language there is a core sentence
     structure. In English this structure is <b>Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)</b>.
     For example, “I went to the store.” Subject = “I”; Verb = “went”; Object =
     “store”. Various articles, linkers, prepositions, etc (e.g. “to” and
     “the”) serve as the framework to connect the Subject-Verb-Object. Of
     course, you can be like Yoda and say “To the store I went.” This would be
     an Object-Subject-Verb order (there are many languages that use this). But
     this is not the normal way that English speakers talk and if you talked
     this way you would sound strange and be difficult to understand. In the
     same way, when learning a language, it is very important to learn the
     simple “normal” way of speaking first. </li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Bisaya, the normal sentence structure is <b>Verb-Actor-Object-Location
(or Referent). </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“Nag-tudlo ko og
bolpen sa lamesa” is literally:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“<b>Pointing</b> <i>(nag-tudlo)</i>
<b>I</b> <i>(ko)</i> <b>a</b> <i>(og)</i> <b>pen</b> <i>(bolpen) <b>on the</b>
(sa) <b>table</b> (lamesa)</i>”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Verb                
</b> <b>Actor</b>                   <b>Object</b>                         <b>Location</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you learn more Bisaya you will find that just like in
English, there are sentences that are structured differently. However, most of
the time this <b>VAOL</b> is the pattern. Early on, almost all sentences we
will use will be this pattern. So, push yourself to use the correct structure
and lead with the Verb, then the actor (usually the subject of the sentence),
then the object (if applicable), then the location (if applicable). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. <b>Introduction to Focuses</b>: In English, we often use
verbal emphasis to indicate the focus of a sentence. For example: If we want to
emphasize the object of a sentence, we might say “I will point to my PEN”,
verbally emphasizing the need to get the Pen (vs a Pencil), that also happens
to belong to me. Alternatively, you might say, “I will point to MY pen”
emphasizing the need to get the pen that is MINE (vs your pen). There are also
more complex grammar constructions that English speakers can use to indicate
the focus of a sentence. For example: “IT IS MY pen that I will point to” or
“It is Me that will point to my pen” or “I will ONLY point to MY pen” or “I
will point to my PEN ONLY.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Bisaya, however, the focus of the sentence is critical to
the entire sentence structure and word usage. And they have a very effective
and simple way of indicating this. Bisaya uses different verb affixes, pronoun
forms, and articles to easily indicate the focus of a sentence without needing
the use of verbal inflections or complex grammar constructions. Here is an
introduction to the concept: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Actor</b>: The focus of the sentence is on who is
doing the action. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“Nag-tudlo <b>ko </b>og
bolpen sa lamesa”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Pointing [am]<b> I </b>a
pen on the table</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“<b>I</b> am pointing
to a pen on the table”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Location / Referent</b>: The focus of the sentence is
on the location or person / thing (Referent) that the action affects. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“Gi-tudlo nako og
bolpen <b><u>ang lamesa</u></b>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Pointing [am] I a pen
on the <b><u>table</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>It is a pen on the
TABLE I am pointing to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Object</b>: The focus of the sentence is on the thing
being acted upon, the object. For example: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“Gi-tudlo nimo <b>ang
bolpen</b> sa lamesa”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Pointing [am] I the <b><u>pen</u>
</b>on the table</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>It is the PEN on the
table I am pointing to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Articles:</b> An article is a grammar feature that helps
connect words and indicate the type of noun. English has only three articles:
a, an, the. However, Cebuano has 12 articles. For this lesson (and for a while)
we will focus on the four most common articles: <b>ang/si, og, and sa</b>.
These articles, except for “Si”, only have approximate English equivalents.
Now, you might see in some books on Cebuano grammar that <b>“ang”</b> = <b>“the”</b>
and<b> “og” </b>= <b>“a” </b>and <b>“sa”</b> = “<b>to/from</b>”, but you will
quickly find that while this is somewhat true, it is not actually true. Quite
often the article construction will just not really match the English. This is
because the article usage in Bisaya is dictated by the Focus system (see
“Introduction to Focuses”), which has no direct equivalent in English. In fact,
you can clearly see this in action in the examples given above where both<b>
“sa”</b> and <b>“ang”</b> can mean “a”, “the” and “on the” depending on the
focus of the sentence. So lets talk about what these articles actually are
doing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Ang : </b>This article goes before the noun that is the
focus of the sentence. It functions similar to “the” in English. It also
functions as a “definite” article, which means that it can be used to refer to
a specific noun, not just any noun. But not exactly. Basically, the focus of
the sentence will dictate what noun <b>“ang”</b> will go in front of. Look at
the examples in the “Introduction to Focuses” to see this in action. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Og/Ug</b> : This article goes before the noun that is the
object. These days, most of the time it is spelled <b>“ug”</b>. But some still
use <b>“og”</b>. The two are interchangeable. NOTE: <b>“og/ug”</b> also is used
as the conjunction “and”. For example: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“Nag-kuha ko <b>ug</b>
bolpen <b>ug </b>papel”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Getting [am] I a pen
and paper</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the focus changes the location of the article changes .
Note that if a pronoun is used, instead of using an article, the form of the
pronoun is changed . Just like English, Pronouns do not get an article .</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Si </b>: This article is a loan word from Spanish and
works exactly like <b>“ang”</b> but is specifically used for proper names only.
It marks the actor as the focus of the sentence when the actor is a proper
name. For example: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Affixes Everywhere: </b>An “Affix” is an addition to a
word that modifies, adds to, or changes the meaning of the root word. In
English we have affixes such as “ed” (past tense) or “ing” (present tense) or
“s/es” (plurals), “ly” (makes into an adjective), etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most Filipino languages make much more extensive use of
affixes than English. Affixes are used to modify verbs to indicate not only
tense (e.g. past / present / future), but also focus (see “Introduction to
Focuses” section), command form of the verb, indicatives (in English should,
would, etc.), make verbs into nouns, nouns into verbs, and many other things.
Affixes can even be stacked together to make more complex forms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A good example of how affixes can change the meaning of a
word is the word <b>“tudlo”</b>. This root means “finger”. But depending on the
context of the sentence and the affix used, it also means “to point” or “to
teach”. Literally the Bisaya for “point to the pencil” is “finger to the
pencil”. And “teach Bisaya” is “finger to me Bisaya”. If you think about it,
pointing and teaching involve significant use of the finger… so it’s a word
picture (the technical explanation is that in its noun form the word <b><i>tudlo</i></b><i>
</i>is “finger”, it its transitive verb form it is “teach”, and it its
ditransitive verb form it is “point”). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Linguists estimate that in Bisaya there may be over
three-thousand possible affix combinations. However, about 50-60 are the most
common forms used that can allow a speaker to communicate a majority of the
Bisaya language. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The affix system is a major advantage of Bisaya and learning
Bisaya. Why? Well, once you learn the root word (e.g. <b>“sulat”</b> = write or
<b>“basa”</b> = read), and the affix system, you can take one root and like
Legos attach affixes to make a huge number of variations of the word. This
means that compared to other languages, learning Bisaya requires learning fewer
total words! Good News! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Affixes in Bisaya mostly occur at the beginning (prefix) or
the end of a word (suffix), but there are a few that you will learn much later
that occur inside the word (infix). Sometimes the affix is written with a
hyphen separating it from the root word, like “ <b>nag-</b> <i>tudlo”</i> . To
help you learn, we will use the hyphen in most early lessons. But most of the
time, in real world use, it is just added to the verb without a hyphen (e.g. <b>“nag
tudlo”</b>) . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>“Nag-kuha <b>si Joy </b>og
bolpen”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Getting [is] <b>Joy </b>a
pen”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this lesson we will not be teaching most details of the
affix system, but you should be aware of some affixes that will be used with
verbs so that you can better accomplish this lesson: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>a. “<b>Nag</b>-”: This affix is a prefix and is added to the
start of the word (like “pre-” in prefix). It is “actor focus” in that it makes
the sentence about the subject taking the action. It is also past/present
continuous. Which means that the action has already started and may be still
ongoing. Thus, it can refer to something that happened in the past and/or is
still ongoing in the present. For example, the root word “tudlo” when used as <b>nag</b>-tudlo
(or <b>nag</b>tudlo) it is the same as both “pointing/teaching” and “was
pointing/teaching” in English. For example, “<b>Nag</b>-tudlo ko og bolpen” =
“I am pointing at a pen” or “<b>Nag-tudlo</b> ko og Bisaya sa imo” = “I am
teaching you Bisaya”. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will discuss more on affixes and pronouns and sentence
order in the next lesson. But if you want to see the full coverage of this
grammar look in Appendix XXX. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note: In this lesson, you will be commanded to take actions.
Command forms of verbs vary. They include the root form of the verb, “verb <b>-i</b>
&quot;, “ <b>i-</b> verb”, “ <b>pag-</b> verb”, and “verb <b>-a</b> ”. For now
just try to listen to the root form of the word and do what you think is being
commanded. A major part of learning language is discovery. Have fun with it!!! </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. <b>Ain’t no “To Be” Verbs</b>: In English, the “to be”
verb is incredibly important to sentence construction. These words are: is, am,
are, to be, will be, being, etc. You should know right now that there is NO direct
equivalent in Bisaya (at more advanced levels you will learn of some
approximate equivelents). For example: “I am pointing to a pen” is “Pointing <b>(nag-tudlo)</b>
I <b>(ko)</b> a<b> (og)</b> pen <b>(bolpen)</b>”. You will notice that there is
no “am”! That is because in Bisaya there is NO “to be” verbs. This can be
challenging for English speakers. Your brain might really want to put an “am”
in the sentence and trip up as you might think that the problem is that you
haven’t learned a word for that. But NO. It does not exist. You might think
that this makes sentences very confusing. But it does not. You just have not
learned how to communicate without the “to be” verb… yet! Don’t worry, while
“to be” verbs are great and useful, but you can totally have a language without
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Maayong Adlaw </b>is a Cebuano formal/informal greeting
during daytime. Cebuano greetings also vary depending on the time of day. Use
with respect and during appropriate time.</p>
