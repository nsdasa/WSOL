## Documentation Sync Policy

**IMPORTANT FOR ALL DEVELOPERS (Human and AI)**

This project maintains three core documentation files that MUST be kept in sync with code changes:

| File | Audience | Update When... |
|------|----------|----------------|
| [`USER_GUIDE.md`](USER_GUIDE.md) | Students & Teachers | User-facing features, UI, or workflows change |
| [`FUNCTIONAL_GUIDE.md`](FUNCTIONAL_GUIDE.md) | Admins & Programmers | System behavior, architecture, or admin features change |
| [`AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) | AI Developers | APIs, modules, data structures, or code patterns change |

### Required Workflow

After making ANY code changes:

1. **Review** each of the three documentation files
2. **Determine** if your changes affect the content described in each file
3. **Update** any affected documentation to reflect the current state
4. **Include** documentation updates in your commit/PR

### Examples

| Change Type | Files to Update |
|-------------|-----------------|
| New UI button | USER_GUIDE.md |
| New admin feature | USER_GUIDE.md, FUNCTIONAL_GUIDE.md |
| New API endpoint | FUNCTIONAL_GUIDE.md, AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md |
| Refactored module | AI_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md |
| New learning module | All three files |
